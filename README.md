# MyProjects
A collection of my Machine Learning and Deep Learning projects

I had begun learning Machine Learning at the beginnning of 2021. Since then I have covered topics like Regression, Classification, Clustering, Model Selection, Dimensionality Reduction, Neural Networks, Computer Vision (Image classification and image generation using GANs).

Some of the included projects are:
1. Water potability classification problem. Task : To predict whether water was drinkable or not (binary classification) based on 9 features.
2. House Price regression problem. Task : To predict a house's price (Regression) based on 18 features regarding house's details.
3. Breast cancer logistic regression problem. Task : To predict whether a patient has breast cancer (Classification) based on features regarding cells.
4. MNIST digit dataset. Task : To predict the digit (0-9) based on an image of the digit. Computer Vision problem solved using a Convolutional Neural Network.
5. Dog and Cat dataset. Task : To classify images of dogs and cats (binary classification). Accuracy isn't explicitly mentioned but is around 98% for VGG16 model architecture.
